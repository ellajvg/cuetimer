# CueTimer

I used to have to flip between my notes and timer app during my workouts to see my program (gasp!). CueTimer is a web app I created that solves this problem, as current and upcoming 
exercise cues are visible with the timer. Another bonus is that the timer is compatible with superset workouts, which is often not a feature, or only a paid one, of other apps. You may 
also use exercise cues and the timer separately if you only need one of them. 

I use WebStorm as my IDE.
